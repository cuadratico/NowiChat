# NowiChat

- NowiChat is a chat application with Bluetooth networks and hybrid cryptography, NowiChat's security is also in the MAC addresses which are encrypted with symmetric cryptography.

- NowiChat also encrypts the mac addresses you save.

- NowiChat's hybrid cryptography is simply a protocol in which symmetric keys are shared with asymmetric keys..

- NowiChat is security-oriented and all information is stored locally, any external problem you have is quickly solved with the NowiChat panic button that deletes all your information.
